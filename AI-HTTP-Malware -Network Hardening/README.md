# AI-Augmented Detection of Malicious HTTP Payload Delivery  
## Deep Learning–Based Web Traffic Threat Classification

---

# Executive Overview

This repository presents a deep learning framework for detecting malware delivery over HTTP traffic.

The study addresses the challenge of malicious payload distribution via trusted web protocols.

---

# Problem Statement

HTTP traffic is frequently allowed through enterprise firewalls.

Attackers exploit this by:

- Embedding malicious download prompts
- Delivering disguised executable files
- Redirecting users to malicious infrastructure

Traditional signature-based detection struggles with:

- Zero-day payloads
- Polymorphic malware
- Domain rotation
