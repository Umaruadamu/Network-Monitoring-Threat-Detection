# Executive Overview

This repository presents my work in enterprise and industrial network monitoring, detection engineering, and threat-informed defensive architecture.

The focus is on:

- Network-layer protocol analysis
- SIEM-based log correlation
- Detection rule engineering
- Threat hypothesis modelling
- Availability and resilience risk evaluation
- Hybrid IT/OT monitoring strategies

The work integrates:

- Research-grade analytical reasoning (PhD-level systems modelling)
- Operational SOC methodologies
- Industrial control system awareness
- AI-driven threat detection concepts

# Strategic Monitoring Philosophy

Effective network monitoring is not log collection.

It is the structured correlation of:

- Protocol behaviour
- System state
- User activity
- Infrastructure configuration
- Business impact

My approach integrates:

1. Protocol-level interpretation
2. Infrastructure control-point analysis
3. Threat modelling
4. Risk-based prioritisation
5. Detection improvement feedback loops
